# LRP Copilot Integration Guide

## 🎯 **The Real Connection**

Your LRP Simulation spreadsheet has a **"LRP Copilot"** menu system that:
1. Takes prompts in **cell B3** (not B1)
2. Requires clicking **"LRP Copilot → Run Prompt"** to execute
3. Generates dynamic results based on your model

## 🔧 **Current Status**

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**
- ✅ Apps Script now writes to **B3** (correct prompt cell)
- ✅ Added attempt to trigger LRP Copilot execution
- ✅ Increased wait time for model processing

### ⚠️ **What Still Needs Your Input:**

The Apps Script **cannot directly trigger menu clicks** like "LRP Copilot → Run Prompt". This is a Google Apps Script limitation.

## 🚀 **Two Integration Options**

### **Option 1: Semi-Automated (Recommended)**
1. **Apps Script writes prompt to B3** ✅ (already implemented)
2. **You manually click "LRP Copilot → Run Prompt"** in the spreadsheet
3. **Apps Script reads the results** ✅ (already implemented)

### **Option 2: Fully Automated (Advanced)**
If your LRP Copilot has a **custom function** that can be called directly, we could trigger it programmatically.

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test the Updated Apps Script**
1. Copy the updated code from `COPY_THIS_TO_APPS_SCRIPT.txt`
2. Paste it into your Apps Script editor
3. Deploy the updated version

### **Step 2: Test End-to-End**
1. Go to https://scenariobuilder.vercel.app/
2. Enter a prompt: "Increase EMEA ARR by $10M; Platform share ≤ 40%"
3. Click "View Comprehensive Analysis"
4. **Check your spreadsheet** - does B3 get updated?
5. **Manually click** "LRP Copilot → Run Prompt" in the spreadsheet
6. **Check the React app** - does it show the calculated results?

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

After clicking "Run Prompt" in your spreadsheet, the LRP Copilot should:
- ✅ Update the 4 strategic options with new values
- ✅ Recalculate feasibility scores
- ✅ Generate new ARR impact numbers
- ✅ Update metrics (presentation rate, win rate, ASP)

## 📊 **Cell Mapping Check**

The Apps Script reads from these cells. **Are these correct for your LRP Copilot output?**

| Option | Feasibility | Old Value | New Value | ARR Change |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **1: Presentation Rate** | B4 | B6 | B7 | B9 |
| **2: Win Rate** | E4 | D6 | D7 | D9 |
| **3: ASP Only** | B13 | B15 | B16 | B18 |
| **4: Blended** | D13 | D15-D20 | D16-D20 | D22 |

**If these cell references are wrong**, let me know where your LRP Copilot actually outputs the results!

## 🎉 **Expected Flow**

1. **User enters prompt** in React app
2. **Apps Script writes** prompt to B3 in spreadsheet
3. **User clicks** "LRP Copilot → Run Prompt" in spreadsheet
4. **LRP model executes** and updates the 4 options
5. **Apps Script reads** the updated values
6. **React app displays** the calculated results

## ❓ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the updated Apps Script** with the B3 fix
2. **Tell me** if the cell references (B4, B6, B7, etc.) are correct for your LRP Copilot output
3. **Confirm** whether your LRP Copilot has any programmatic triggers we can use

This will give us a **true integration** with your LRP model! 🚀
